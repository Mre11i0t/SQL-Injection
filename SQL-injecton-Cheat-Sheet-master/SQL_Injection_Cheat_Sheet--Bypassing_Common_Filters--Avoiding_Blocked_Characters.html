<body><h1><b><u>Avoiding Blocked Characters</u></b></h1>If the application removes or encodes some characters that are often used in SQLi attacks, you may still be able to perform an attack.<br />For example, the single quotation mark is not required if you are injecting into a numeric data field or column name.<br /><img src="images\14-1.png" alt="images\14-1.png" /><br />If you do need to introduce a string in to your attack payload, you can do this without needing to use quotes. <br />In MySQL, the following statement:<br /><strong>SELECT username FROM users WHERE isadmin = 2 union select name from sqlol.ssn where name='herp derper'--</strong><br />is equivalent to:<br />    <strong>SELECT username FROM users WHERE isadmin = 2 union select name from sqlol.ssn where name=0x4865727020446572706572--</strong><br /><img src="images\14-2.png" alt="images\14-2.png" /><br />If the comment symbol is blocked, you can often craft your injected data such that it does not break the syntax of the surrounding query.<br />In the example opposite we have altered the structure of the query with the AS keyword.<br />The <strong>MySQL AS</strong> keyword is used to specify an alternate name to use when referring to either a table or a column in a table.<br /><img src="images\14-3.png" alt="images\14-3.png" /><br />Additionally, in some cases you can use different characters to comment out the rest of the query.<br />Here we have used the # character<br /><img src="images\14-4.png" alt="images\14-4.png" /><br /></body></html>
